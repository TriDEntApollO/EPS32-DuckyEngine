# ESP32-DuckyEngine ü¶Ü

ESP32-DuckyEngine is a lightweight **Ducky Script interpreter** for the ESP32 with **BLE keyboard** support. It enables the ESP32 to emulate a Bluetooth keyboard and execute scripted keystrokes, making it perfect for automation, macros, and penetration testing.

## Features
- ‚úÖ **Ducky Script Support** ‚Äì Execute scripts with standard Ducky commands
- ‚úÖ **Bluetooth HID Keyboard** ‚Äì Emulates a BLE keyboard for seamless input
- ‚úÖ **Custom Macro Engine** ‚Äì Send keystrokes, type text, and trigger shortcuts
- ‚úÖ **Configurable Delays & Intervals** ‚Äì Fine-tune script execution speed


## Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
- **ESP32 Board**
- **Arduino IDE** or **PlatformIO**
- **BleKeyboard Library** - [use this](https://github.com/TriDEntApollO/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard-V2) for updated fixes as the original is not being maintianed anymore
- **Make sure you can use the ESP32 with the Arduino IDE. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/).**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installation
1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/TriDEntApollO/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard-V2/releases) or download the [code](https://github.com/TriDEntApollO/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard-V2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) as a ZIP file for latest commits.
2. In the Arduino IDE go to `"Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library..."` and select the `ZIP` file you just downloaded.
3. Restart Arduino IDE to recognize the new library.
4. You can now go to `"File" -> "Examples" -> "ESP32 DuckyEngine"` and select any of the examples to get started.


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Example Usage
Here's a simple example that executes a Ducky Script on connection:

```cpp
#include <BleKeyboard.h>
#include "DuckyEngine.h"

BleKeyboard bleKeyboard("ESP32 Ducky", "TridentApollo", 100);
DuckyEngine macro(bleKeyboard);

const char* duckyScript = R"rawliteral(
GUI r
DELAY 200
STRING notepad
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING Hello, this is an automated script!
ENTER
)rawliteral";

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    bleKeyboard.begin();
    while (!bleKeyboard.isConnected()) {
        delay(500);
    }
    Serial.println("Executing Script...");
    macro.executeScript(duckyScript);
    Serial.println("Execution Finished!");
}

void loop() {
    // No loop function needed
}
```
